Welcome to my personal repository of notes! This collection includes various topics that I have studied, summarized in markdown files for easy reading and reference.

## Repository Structure

- `Time Complexity Analysis/`: Notes on algorithmic efficiency, Big O notation, and common algorithm complexities.

- `Programming Languages/`: Syntax and features of various programming languages I've explored.

Each directory is structured by topic and contains `.md` files with detailed notes on the subject.

# About Me

Hi, I am Akshay Verma, I am a software developer from India. 
I specialize in backend development (Go,PHP,Python,NodeJS)

## My motivation for this repo

As you develop your skills and become good in development , no matter how good you are there will be many opportunities that you will lose just because you failed to solve a coding question.It is impossible to avoid DSA if you want to clear job interviews for SE or SDE roles. Therfore I have created this repo to store all the information that I have learned during my job preparation time.
